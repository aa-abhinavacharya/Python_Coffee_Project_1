# Project : Coffee Trade Analysis for a Major Industry Player

### Note :- All the files used for data analysis are present in the repository. Project is prepared with the help of the course in Udemy [Python Data Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-pandas/) by Maven Analytics. Datasets are present in the link-[Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-visualization-matplotlib-seaborn/?srsltid=AfmBOop1YNPr3dWseg0L2AXe6v50HlWa4ne2Q7JMvhT3Fl-q7DuIaszj).

## Project Brief :- A major global coffee trader has approached in seeking independent, data-driven insights into coffee production, with a particular focus on Brazil‚Äôs position relative to other coffee-producing nations. This request signals a strategic review of their sourcing practices and cost structures in an increasingly competitive and volatile market.

### Objective Brief :-

    Provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of:

1.  Brazil‚Äôs coffee production versus other key producing countries.

2.  Importer volumes compared to the prices paid, identifying potential imbalances.

3.  Opportunities to optimize sourcing by evaluating if cost efficiencies or margin improvements can be unlocked through market diversification.

## Objectives :-

1.  Read in data from multiple csv files.

2.  Reshape the data to prepare it for visualization.

3.  Build & customize charts to communicate the key insights to the client.

## How the insights help us in coffee industry analysis ?

####  Top 5 Producers Over Time ‚Äî Line Chart

This visualization shows how production leadership has shifted globally ‚Äî whether Brazil has maintained dominance or if other nations are catching up.
üëâ Helps assess market competitiveness and Brazil‚Äôs long-term viability as a top supplier.

#### Brazil's Share of Global Production ‚Äî Trend Line

Shows how Brazil‚Äôs percentage contribution to global production has evolved. A declining share may suggest rising competition, while a stable or growing share may support continued reliance on Brazil.
üëâ Helps in forecasting sourcing stability and identifying the need to diversify.

#### Brazil vs. Vietnam / Venezuela ‚Äî Scatterplots

Side-by-side production comparisons reveal how Brazil stacks up against key competitors in volume. Trends may show whether other nations are becoming more efficient or scaling rapidly.
üëâ Useful for evaluating supply chain risks and negotiation leverage with suppliers.

#### Composition of Global Production ‚Äî Pie Chart

Presents a snapshot of how much of the world‚Äôs coffee production is concentrated among top producers versus more fragmented among smaller nations.
üëâ Guides sourcing diversification ‚Äî is there untapped potential in ‚Äúthe rest of the world‚Äù?

#### Brazil‚Äôs Share in 1990 vs. 2018 ‚Äî Donut Charts

Highlights historical change in Brazil‚Äôs dominance. A shrinking slice could signal reduced influence, while a steady one confirms Brazil‚Äôs leadership role.
üëâ Helps the client decide whether to double down or diversify from Brazil.

#### Coffee Consumption vs. Prices ‚Äî Dual Axis Bar Chart

Reveals whether countries that consume more coffee also pay more for it ‚Äî indicating potential pricing power, market maturity, or inefficiencies.
üëâ Enables strategy around which markets offer better pricing leverage or where price sensitivity might exist.


## How These Insights Can Be Utilized ?

1. Sourcing Strategy:
Understand where Brazil fits into the global production map and whether alternative suppliers like Vietnam or others are worth exploring to manage cost and risk.

2. Market Diversification:
Identify whether it's beneficial to expand sourcing beyond Brazil, especially if its global share is declining or if other nations offer similar volumes at lower prices.

3. Price Optimization:
Match consumption with price trends to optimize trading strategies ‚Äî potentially buying from countries where high volume doesn't equate to high prices.

4. Long-Term Planning:
Trends from 1990 to 2018 show how the market is shifting, helping guide long-term sourcing and investment decisions.
