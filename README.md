# Project : Coffee Trade Analysis for a Major Industry Player

### Note :- All the files used for data analysis are present in the repository. Project is prepared with the help of the course in Udemy [Python Data Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-pandas/) by Maven Analytics. Datasets are present in the link-[Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-visualization-matplotlib-seaborn/?srsltid=AfmBOop1YNPr3dWseg0L2AXe6v50HlWa4ne2Q7JMvhT3Fl-q7DuIaszj).

## Project Brief :- A major global coffee trader has approached in seeking independent, data-driven insights into coffee production, with a particular focus on Brazil’s position relative to other coffee-producing nations. This request signals a strategic review of their sourcing practices and cost structures in an increasingly competitive and volatile market.

### Objective Brief :-

Provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of:

1.Brazil’s coffee production versus other key producing countries.

2.Importer volumes compared to the prices paid, identifying potential imbalances.

3.Opportunities to optimize sourcing by evaluating if cost efficiencies or margin improvements can be unlocked through market diversification.

## Objectives :-

1. Read in data from multiple csv files.

2.  Reshape the data to prepare it for visualization.

3.  Build & customize charts to communicate the key insights to the client.
